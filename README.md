# drawingandtitles
an easy iOS app displaying the use of navigation controllers and delegation that I made for my intro to iOS development class. In the future, I'd like to complete the following challenge:


Create a third arena called “Magical Arena”. In this arena, you will create a new
subclass of UIView whose background color is randomly chosen upon creation. Every new tap on
the screen should then use this class to display a square with a random color.
